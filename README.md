require login for one to acess a page


Do you have a page that requires user details without them actually writing their details there?

Or maybe a page that cant get into the wrong hands example a cpanel

The function checks for the password then redirects to the given page with a unique number called id.

if the id is altered it'll automatically redirect to the login page and generate a new one when the user logs in

Where the user opens the service page without logging in , They are redirected to the login page too
